## 🛠️ API Endpoints

### New Enhanced Endpoints

#### Bulk Step Execution
```http
POST /api/execute_steps_bulk
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "step_ids": ["step_1", "step_2", "step_3"]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "executed_steps": 2,
    "failed_steps": 1,
    "results": [...],
    "failures": [...],
    "status": "completed"
}
```

#### PDF Generation
```http
GET /api/download_plan_pdf/{plan_id}
```

**Response:** PDF file stream with appropriate headers

### Existing Endpoints
- `POST /api/plan` - Create study plan
- `POST /api/execute_step` - Execute single step (now with auto-results)
- `GET /api/plan/{plan_id}` - Get plan with step statuses
- `GET /api/logs` - Get system logs
- `GET /api/health` - Health check

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify all new features:

```bash
python test_new_features.py
```

This will test:
- API connectivity
- Plan creation with overview
- Single step execution with auto-results
- Bulk execution functionality
- PDF generation
